1. Project Description<br>
The purpose we make PANBALDEKRI is to help other people who are beginners in baking to make some cakes or other pastry type desserts with some recipes that are provided on our website. From the recipes on the website,they can practice their baking skills and gain more knowledge in making pastry .Besides, they can contact us through the websites if they have any problem regarding the websites or anything to ask about  the recipes. <br>
There are a lot of bakery recipes around the internet made by many people but we will use a few recipes from Chef Wan bakery recipes book. The first one is “Burn Cheesecake” recipe. There are four steps in total to make the cake. Next is “Walnut Carrot Cake with Orange Cream” containing 5 steps for the preparation of the cake. The last one is “Almond Crunch Biscuits”. We will use these 3 recipes for our group project website. <br>
Our website project consists of 5 people as a team. Not only that, the website project consists of 5 pages and each of us has been assigned to a specific page website. The first pages would be the home and the home page will be created by Ridia Kashmeri. The second page is the most important page within our project website which is the recipe page. The recipe is assigned to Muhammad Haikal. The third website page is the blog page and it has been assigned to our group leader, Ahmad Nuruddin. We name the fourth page as the about us page. The about us page will be done by Batrisyia Balqis. The last page is the contact us page and has been assigned to Muhammad Irfan Danial. <br>
For any website, logo and its special taglines are very important to represent the motivation and encouragement of that website in one word or in one line. Our website which is carrying the logo namely PANBALDEKRI refers to a special bonding between 5 friends who have started their journey to make this website. This name came from the broken names of 5 friends- Pandan, N,Balbat,Deku,Ri. Their love and passion for bakery which works as the inspiration, motivation and encouragement for this website. As a result the tagline of the website became like this “Love Our Bakery”. While thinking about this tagline, we consider the sync between the logo name and the tagline to make it interesting. Likely people can find our website interested by saying
“ PANBALDEKRI, Love Our Bakery.”<br> <br>
