           <h1>Inspiration</h1>
           <p>
             In our site, we have different kind of breads which is our speciality.The breads are brown bread,white bread ,french bread,normal bread etc.To do the baking for bread,the inspiration came from a healthy life.Yes a healthy life.A good cruchy bread toast and a hot cup of coffee can easily make our day.Instead of having rice we can have brown bread which is way more healthier.
